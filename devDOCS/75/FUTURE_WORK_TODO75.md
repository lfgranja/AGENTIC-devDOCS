# Future Work To Do from PR #75

## General Future Work

*   **Refine POSTPR Documentation Generation**: Develop a more automated and template-driven process for generating POSTPR documentation to minimize manual errors and ensure consistency across PRs.
*   **Explore Advanced CI/CD Security Practices**: Investigate and potentially integrate other types of security scanning (e.g., DAST - Dynamic Application Security Testing, secret scanning beyond basic CodeQL capabilities) into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Suggestions from qodo-merge-pro

*   **Evaluate Checkov for Workflow Security Scanning**: Research and evaluate `Checkov` as an alternative or complementary tool to `actionlint` for comprehensive security scanning of GitHub Actions workflows.
*   **Implement Explicit Build Failure for CodeQL High Severity Findings**: If GitHub's built-in security tab integration for CodeQL is not sufficient for direct build failure, implement a separate step to explicitly fail the build when high-severity findings are reported.
