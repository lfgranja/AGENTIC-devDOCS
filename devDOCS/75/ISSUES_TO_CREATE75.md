# Issues to Create from PR #75

## Issues from General Observations

*   **Issue: Refactor POSTPR Documentation Generation Process**:
    *   **Description**: The current manual process for creating POSTPR documentation (Lessons Learned, Future Work, Issues to Create) is prone to errors and inconsistencies, as demonstrated by PR #75 initially containing documentation for PR #74. This issue aims to automate and template this process.
    *   **Tasks**:
        *   Research tools or scripts for automated POSTPR documentation generation.
        *   Design a template structure that can be easily populated with PR-specific information (e.g., PR number, title, key feedback).
        *   Implement a workflow or script to generate these documents automatically upon PR merge.
        *   Ensure the generated documents are correctly linked and stored.

## Issues from qodo-merge-pro's Feedback

*   **Issue: Evaluate and Integrate Checkov for Workflow Security Scanning**:
    *   **Description**: While `actionlint` provides syntax and best practice checks for GitHub Actions workflows, `Checkov` offers more comprehensive infrastructure-as-code (IaC) security scanning. This issue is to evaluate `Checkov`'s applicability to our GitHub Actions workflows and integrate it if beneficial.
    *   **Tasks**:
        *   Research `Checkov`'s capabilities for scanning GitHub Actions workflows.
        *   Set up a proof-of-concept workflow to run `Checkov` on our `.github/workflows/` directory.
        *   Analyze the results and determine the value added compared to `actionlint`.
        *   If deemed beneficial, integrate `Checkov` into our CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Issue: Implement Explicit Build Failure for CodeQL High Severity Findings**:
    *   **Description**: Currently, CodeQL analysis results are uploaded to GitHub's security tab. While GitHub can be configured to fail checks based on severity, a more direct and immediate build failure mechanism might be desired for high-severity findings.
    *   **Tasks**:
        *   Investigate methods to programmatically access CodeQL analysis results (e.g., SARIF files) within a GitHub Actions workflow.
        *   Develop a script or use an existing action to parse these results.
        *   Implement logic to fail the build if high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.
        *   Integrate this step into the `codeql-analysis.yml` workflow.
    *   **Labels**: `enhancement`, `security`, `ci`
