### Issue 1: Enhance Project Board Workflow to Move Items

*   **Title**: `feat(ci): Enhance Project Board Workflow to Move Items`
*   **Description**: The current project board automation only adds new PRs to an initial column. To make this more powerful, the workflow should be enhanced to move items between columns based on PR events.
*   **Labels**: `enhancement`, `ci`
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Configure the workflow to trigger on `pull_request` events like `review_submitted` or `closed`.
    *   [ ] When a PR is approved, move it to a "Ready for Merge" column.
    *   [ ] When a PR is merged, move it to the "Done" column.
    *   [ ] If a review requests changes, move the PR to a "Changes Requested" column.
