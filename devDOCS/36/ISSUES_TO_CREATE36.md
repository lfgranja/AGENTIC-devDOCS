# Issues to Create from PR #36

Based on the future work identified, the following issues should be created in the repository:

---

### Issue 1: Expand PR Labeler Configuration with Granular Rules

*   **Title**: `feat(ci): Expand PR Labeler Configuration with Granular Rules`
*   **Description**: The current `.github/labeler.yml` is minimal. This task involves expanding the configuration to automatically label PRs based on the files they modify. This will improve our ability to quickly categorize and review incoming contributions.
*   **Labels**: `enhancement`, `ci`
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Add a `ci` label for changes in the `.github/workflows` directory.
    *   [ ] Add a `python` label for changes to `.py` files.
    *   [ ] Add a `tests` label for changes in the `tests/` directory.
    *   [ ] Add a `documentation` label for changes to `.md` files (already present, but verify).
    *   [ ] Research and add other useful labels based on the project structure.

### Issue 2: Add Validation Workflow for labeler.yml

*   **Title**: `feat(ci): Add Validation Workflow for labeler.yml`
*   **Description**: To prevent syntax errors in the `.github/labeler.yml` file from breaking the PR labeling process, we should create a dedicated CI workflow. This workflow will trigger whenever `.github/labeler.yml` is modified and validate its syntax against a predefined schema.
*   **Labels**: `enhancement`, `ci`
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Choose a suitable schema validation tool (e.g., JSON Schema, pykwalify).
    *   [ ] Define a schema for the `labeler.yml` file.
    *   [ ] Create a new GitHub Actions workflow that runs the validator.
    *   [ ] Ensure the workflow triggers only on changes to the target file.
