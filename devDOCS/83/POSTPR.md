## Future Work for PR #83

This document outlines tasks identified during the review and implementation of PR #83 that are not critical for its immediate merge but should be addressed in future iterations.

### 1. Enhance Automated Review Feedback

**Description:** Investigate why automated code suggestion tools like `gemini-code-assist` and `qodo-merge-pro` did not have their comments captured by the API calls used for PR analysis. This is crucial for improving the agent's ability to gather comprehensive feedback.

**Rationale:** Improve the operational effectiveness of automated review processes and ensure all feedback sources are considered.

### 2. Implement Actual PR Commands

**Description:** The original intent of Issue #82 and the PR title suggested implementing new commands for interacting with GitHub Pull Requests directly from the CLI. This PR primarily focused on CI/CD workflow improvements. A new issue should be created to develop and integrate these actual PR-related commands.

**Rationale:** Fulfill the broader scope implied by the initial request and enhance CLI functionality.

### 3. Standardize Shell Scripting in Workflows

**Description:** Conduct a comprehensive review of all shell scripts within the `.github/workflows` directory. Ensure consistent and robust quoting of variables, proper error handling, and adherence to shell scripting best practices across all workflows.

**Rationale:** Prevent future CI failures due to subtle shell scripting issues and improve the maintainability of workflow configurations.

### 4. Integrate `shellcheck` and `pyflakes` into `actionlint`

**Description:** Enhance the `actionlint` workflow by installing `shellcheck` and `pyflakes` in the CI environment. This will allow `actionlint` to leverage these tools for more comprehensive static analysis of shell scripts and Python code embedded within GitHub Actions workflows.

**Rationale:** Improve the depth and accuracy of static analysis for workflow files, catching potential issues earlier in the development cycle.

### 5. Add `.venv/` to `.gitignore` and Remove from History

**Description:** The `.venv/` virtual environment directory was inadvertently committed to the repository. It should be added to `.gitignore` to prevent future accidental commits. Additionally, steps should be taken to remove `.venv/` from the repository's history to keep the repository clean and reduce its size.

**Rationale:** Maintain a clean repository, reduce repository size, and avoid committing unnecessary build artifacts.
