# Issues to Create for PR #16: Enhanced Test Coverage for Automation Scripts

### Issue 1: Add Integration Tests for External API Calls

**Title:** Add Integration Tests for External API Calls
**Description:** The current test suite uses extensive mocking for external APIs (OpenAI, GitHub) but lacks integration tests that actually call these services with test accounts. Adding integration tests would provide better confidence in the actual behavior of the automation scripts when interacting with real services.

**Labels:** enhancement, testing
**Milestone:** N/A
**Priority:** medium
**Complexity:** medium
**Context:** During the implementation of enhanced test coverage, we focused on unit tests with mocking for faster execution and independence from external service availability. However, integration tests that actually call the APIs would provide better assurance of correct behavior in real-world scenarios.

### Issue 2: Implement Property-Based Testing for Data Validation

**Title:** Implement Property-Based Testing for Data Validation
**Description:** Add property-based testing for data validation functions to ensure they handle a wide range of inputs correctly. This would complement the existing example-based tests with more comprehensive coverage of edge cases and unexpected inputs.

**Labels:** enhancement, testing
**Milestone:** N/A
**Priority:** low
**Complexity:** high
**Context:** Property-based testing would help identify edge cases that example-based tests might miss, particularly for data validation and transformation functions in the automation scripts.

### Issue 3: Add Performance Tests for Large-Scale Operations

**Title:** Add Performance Tests for Large-Scale Operations
**Description:** Implement performance tests to ensure the automation scripts can handle large-scale operations efficiently. This would include tests for processing large numbers of files, complex configuration files, and extensive documentation generation tasks.

**Labels:** enhancement, testing, performance
**Milestone:** N/A
**Priority:** low
**Complexity:** high
**Context:** As the automation scripts are used for larger projects, performance becomes increasingly important. Performance tests would help identify bottlenecks and ensure scalability.

### Issue 4: Add More Specific Error Types for Different Failure Modes

**Title:** Add More Specific Error Types for Different Failure Modes
**Description:** Implement more specific error types for different failure modes in the automation scripts to provide better error handling and debugging capabilities. Currently, most errors are handled generically.

**Labels:** enhancement, error-handling
**Milestone:** N/A
**Priority:** medium
**Complexity:** medium
**Context:** More specific error types would enable better error handling in client code and provide clearer debugging information when issues occur.

### Issue 5: Implement Configuration Validation

**Title:** Implement Configuration Validation
**Description:** Add validation for configuration file schemas to catch misconfigurations early and provide helpful error messages. Currently, the scripts may fail with cryptic errors when configuration values are missing or invalid.

**Labels:** enhancement, configuration, error-handling
**Milestone:** N/A
**Priority:** medium
**Complexity:** low
**Context:** Configuration validation would improve the user experience by providing clear error messages and preventing runtime failures due to misconfigured settings.
