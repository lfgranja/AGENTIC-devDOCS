### Issue 1: Consolidate and Refine Auto-Assign Reviewer Configuration

*   **Title**: `chore(config): Consolidate and Refine Auto-Assign Reviewer Configuration`
*   **Description**: The current `.github/auto_assign.yml` file has a separate rule for each label, even when they assign the same reviewer. This can be made more concise and maintainable by grouping labels into a single rule.

**Tasks**:
*   [ ] Refactor the `.github/auto_assign.yml` file to group labels that share the same reviewer into a single rule.
*   [ ] Ensure the refactored configuration maintains the correct assignment logic.
*   [ ] Consider adding a default reviewer for PRs that don't match any specific label." --label "chore,ci,enhancement"
