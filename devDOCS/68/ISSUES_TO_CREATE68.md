# Issues to Create from PR #68

Based on the future work identified, the following issues should be created:

---

### Issue 1: Implement Automated Security Scanning for GitHub Actions Workflows

*   **Title**: `feat(security): Implement Automated Security Scanning for GitHub Actions Workflows`
*   **Description**: To proactively identify security vulnerabilities in our CI/CD pipelines, we should integrate an automated scanning tool that checks for common misconfigurations and best practice violations.

**Tasks**:
*   [ ] Research and select a suitable tool for scanning GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., `StepSecurity`, `OpenSSF Scorecard`).
*   [ ] Integrate the selected tool into a new or existing CI workflow that runs on changes to files in `.github/workflows/`.
*   [ ] Configure the tool to fail the build or create alerts for high-severity issues.

### Issue 2: Document and Standardize PAT Management Strategy

*   **Title**: `docs(security): Document and Standardize PAT Management Strategy`
*   **Description**: As we increasingly rely on Personal Access Tokens (PATs) for our CI/CD automation, we need a clear and secure strategy for managing them. This issue is to create documentation that outlines our PAT management policy.

**Tasks**:
*   [ ] Define and document naming conventions for PATs (e.g., `REPO_ACTION_PAT`).
*   [ ] Create guidelines for the principle of least privilege when defining PAT scopes.
*   [ ] Establish a policy for PAT rotation and lifecycle management.
*   [ ] Add this documentation to a new security-focused document or to `AGENTIC/WORKFLOW.md`.
