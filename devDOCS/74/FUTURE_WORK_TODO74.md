# Future Work To Do from PR #74

## General Future Work

*   **Refactor Legacy Components**: Identify and refactor older parts of the codebase that interact with the changes introduced in PR #74 to ensure consistency and maintainability.
*   **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish a baseline for performance metrics and regularly benchmark new features to prevent regressions.
*   **Improve CI/CD Pipeline**: Explore opportunities to further automate testing, deployment, and documentation generation within the CI/CD pipeline.

## Suggestions from qodo-merge-pro

*   **Advanced Git Hooks**: Investigate and implement more advanced Git hooks to enforce coding standards and pre-empt common PR issues before submission.
*   **Automated Dependency Updates**: Set up automated tools for monitoring and updating project dependencies to mitigate security vulnerabilities and keep libraries current.
*   **Branching Strategy Review**: Revisit and potentially refine the branching strategy based on the challenges encountered during PR #74's integration.

## Suggestions from gemini-code-assist

*   **AI-Assisted Code Generation**: Explore integrating AI tools for generating boilerplate code or suggesting improvements to accelerate development.
*   **Comprehensive Type Hinting**: Implement more extensive type hinting across the codebase to improve code clarity, reduce bugs, and enhance IDE support.
*   **Modularization of Core Logic**: Further modularize the core logic introduced in PR #74 to allow for easier extension and independent testing in the future.
