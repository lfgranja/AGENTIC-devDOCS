### Issue 1: Implement Automatic Reviewer Assignment Based on PR Labels

*   **Title**: `feat(ci): Implement Automatic Reviewer Assignment Based on PR Labels`
*   **Description**: With the recent improvements to our PR labeling, we can now leverage these labels to streamline the review process. This task is to create a new GitHub Actions workflow that automatically assigns reviewers to a PR based on the labels that have been applied.
*   **Labels**: `enhancement`, `ci`
*   **Tasks**:
    *   [ ] Research and select a suitable GitHub Action for assigning reviewers (e.g., `actions/assign-reviewers`).
    *   [ ] Create a new workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/auto-assign.yml`).
    *   [ ] Configure the workflow to trigger when a label is added to a pull request.
    *   [ ] Define a mapping of labels to reviewers (e.g., `python` -> `reviewer-A`, `ci` -> `reviewer-B`). This mapping should be stored in a configurable way, perhaps in the workflow file itself or in a separate configuration file.
    *   [ ] Test the workflow to ensure reviewers are assigned correctly.
