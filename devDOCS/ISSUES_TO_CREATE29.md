# Issues to Create for PR #29: Add Caching Mechanisms to GitHub Actions Workflows

### Issue 1: Implement Advanced Caching Strategies

**Title:** Implement Advanced Caching Strategies
**Description:** Implement multi-level caching with different expiration policies and cache warming mechanisms for better performance and predictability.

**Labels:** enhancement, performance, caching
**Milestone:** N/A
**Priority:** medium
**Complexity:** high
**Context:** During the implementation of basic caching mechanisms for GitHub Actions workflows, we identified opportunities to optimize cache performance with advanced strategies like multi-level caching, expiration policies, and cache warming mechanisms.

### Issue 2: Add Comprehensive Error Handling for Caching Failures

**Title:** Add Comprehensive Error Handling for Caching Failures
**Description:** Add more specific error types for different caching failure modes, implement retry mechanisms for transient cache failures, and add more detailed logging for debugging cache-related issues.

**Labels:** enhancement, error-handling, caching
**Milestone**: N/A
**Priority:** medium
**Complexity**: medium
**Context**: While implementing basic caching, we identified the need for more robust error handling to deal with various caching failure scenarios such as network issues, storage limits, and corruption.

### Issue 3: Implement Cache Size Limits and Expiration Policies

**Title:** Implement Cache Size Limits and Expiration Policies
**Description:** Add cache size limits to prevent excessive storage usage and implement expiration policies to ensure cached data remains fresh.

**Labels:** enhancement, caching, performance
**Milestone**: N/A
**Priority**: medium
**Complexity**: medium
**Context**: Basic caching implementation doesn't include size limits or expiration policies, which could lead to excessive storage usage over time and stale cached data.

### Issue 4: Add Cache Performance Monitoring and Reporting

**Title:** Add Cache Performance Monitoring and Reporting
**Description:** Implement cache performance monitoring with hit/miss ratio tracking and reporting to monitor cache effectiveness over time.

**Labels:** enhancement, caching, monitoring
**Milestone**: N/A
**Priority**: low
**Complexity**: medium
**Context**: To optimize caching strategies, we need visibility into cache performance metrics like hit/miss ratios and restore times.

---

### Issue 5: Implement Cross-Platform Cache Compatibility

**Title:** Implement Cross-Platform Cache Compatibility
**Description:** Add support for caching in other CI/CD platforms (GitLab CI, Jenkins, etc.) and implement cross-platform cache compatibility.

**Labels:** enhancement, caching, cross-platform
**Milestone**: N/A
**Priority**: low
**Complexity**: high
**Context**: Current caching implementation is specific to GitHub Actions. Supporting other CI/CD platforms would increase the utility of the automation scripts.
