# Lessons Learned - Initial Setup

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

1. **Git Branch Management**: We encountered challenges with managing multiple branches (master and main) in the repository. The solution was to consolidate our changes into the main branch, which is the standard default branch for modern GitHub repositories.

2. **Merge Conflicts**: We experienced merge conflicts when trying to integrate changes from the remote main branch with our local changes. We resolved this by manually resolving the conflicts in the README.md file and completing the merge.

3. **Repository Initialization**: Setting up the initial repository structure required careful consideration of which files to include and how to organize them according to the AGENTIC guidelines.

## Design Decisions

1. **Branch Strategy**: We decided to use the main branch as the primary branch rather than maintaining a separate master branch, following modern GitHub conventions.

2. **File Organization**: We organized the documentation files in the AGENTIC directory to separate behavioral guidelines from workflow processes and post-PR procedures.

3. **Attribution**: We added proper attribution to the original source of the AGENTIC.md content in the README.md file to maintain transparency about the project's origins.

## Unexpected Issues

1. **Unrelated Histories**: When trying to merge changes from the remote main branch, we encountered issues with unrelated git histories. We resolved this by using the --allow-unrelated-histories flag during the merge.

2. **Editor Configuration**: During the merge commit process, we encountered issues with the default editor not being properly configured in the terminal environment.

## Performance Considerations

1. **Git Operations**: We optimized our git operations by batching related commands and using appropriate flags to minimize the number of operations needed.

2. **File Staging**: We carefully selected which files to stage for the initial commit to ensure we only included the intended files and excluded the root QWEN.md file as requested.

## Testing Strategies

1. **Verification Commands**: We used git status, git log, and git diff commands throughout the process to verify that our changes were being applied correctly.

2. **Remote Verification**: We checked the remote repository status to ensure our pushes were successful and that the branches were properly set up.

## Deviations from Original Plan

1. **Branch Naming**: We deviated from using the master branch as the primary branch and instead consolidated everything into the main branch to follow modern conventions.

2. **Attribution Addition**: We added attribution for the original source of the AGENTIC.md content, which was not part of the initial plan but was identified as an important requirement for open source projects.
