### Issue 2: Implement Smarter Conditional Steps in GitHub Actions

**Title:** Implement Smarter Conditional Steps in GitHub Actions
**Description:** Add smarter conditional steps to GitHub Actions workflows to skip unnecessary operations based on file changes or other criteria.

### Issue 3: Add Machine Learning-Based Automatic Labeling

**Title:** Add Machine Learning-Based Automatic Labeling
**Description:** Implement machine learning-based automatic labeling for PRs based on the content of code changes, providing more intelligent and accurate labeling than rule-based approaches.

**Labels:** enhancement, workflow, ml
**Milestone:** N/A
**Priority:** low
**Complexity:** high
**Context:** The current PR labeler uses simple rule-based logic. A machine learning approach could provide more accurate and nuanced labeling based on historical data.

### Issue 4: Add Dynamic Label Creation for New Categories

**Title:** Add Dynamic Label Creation for New Categories
**Description:** Implement dynamic label creation for new categories that aren't already defined in the repository, allowing the labeler to suggest new labels when appropriate.

**Labels:** enhancement, workflow, configuration
**Milestone**: N/A
**Priority:** medium
**Complexity:** medium
**Context:** The current labeler can only apply existing labels. Adding dynamic label creation would make it more flexible and adaptive to new project needs.

### Issue 5: Add Label Suggestions for Human Review

**Title:** Add Label Suggestions for Human Review
**Description:** Implement a mechanism to suggest labels for human review rather than automatically applying them, providing a balance between automation and human oversight.

**Labels:** enhancement, workflow, ux
**Milestone**: N/A
**Priority:** medium
**Complexity**: medium
**Context**: For some repositories, fully automatic labeling might be too aggressive. Adding a suggestion mode would allow humans to review and approve labels before they're applied.
