# GitHub Actions Labeler Workflow Issue

## Problem Description

The PR labeler workflow in `.github/workflows/pr-labeler.yml` is failing with the error:
```
Resource not accessible by integration
```

This occurs when the workflow tries to add labels to PR #16 using the GitHub API.

## Investigation

1. **Permissions Added**: I added the following permissions to the workflow:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: read
     pull-requests: write
   ```

2. **Error Details**: The error message indicates that the GitHub token doesn't have the necessary permissions to add labels to the PR, even with the `pull-requests: write` permission.

3. **Impact**: This workflow failure is not preventing the PR from being merged since:
   - All core tests are passing (test (3.9), test (3.10), test (3.11))
   - Code quality, dependency check, and documentation generation workflows are passing
   - The labeler workflow is not a required check for merging

## Possible Solutions

1. **Use GitHub App Token**: Instead of the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, use a GitHub App token with extended permissions.

2. **Repository-Level Permissions**: Ensure the repository has the correct permissions configured for the default token.

3. **Alternative Labeling Approach**: Use a different GitHub API endpoint or approach for labeling PRs.

4. **Disable Workflow Temporarily**: Comment out or disable the workflow until the permission issue is resolved.
