## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Performance Issues with Large Data Sets
During the implementation of the new data processing feature, we encountered significant performance issues when handling large data sets. The initial implementation had a time complexity of O(n^2) which caused noticeable delays with larger inputs.

**Solution:** We optimized the algorithm to use a hash map for lookups, reducing the time complexity to O(n). This significantly improved performance, with processing time decreasing from several minutes to just a few seconds for large data sets.

### Challenge: Integration with Legacy API
Integrating with the legacy API proved challenging due to inconsistent response formats and lack of documentation.

**Solution:** We created a wrapper layer that normalizes the API responses and handles errors gracefully. We also documented the API behavior in our internal documentation to help future developers.

## Design Decisions

### Decision: Use of Redis for Caching
We decided to implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data to improve response times.

**Rationale:** 
- Redis provides fast in-memory data storage
- It has built-in expiration mechanisms
- It's widely supported and has good community support
- It scales well for our expected load

### Decision: Microservices Architecture
We chose to implement the new feature as a separate microservice rather than integrating it into the existing monolith.

**Rationale:**
- Better separation of concerns
- Independent scaling capabilities
- Easier to maintain and test
- Allows for different technology stacks if needed in the future

## Unexpected Issues

### Issue: Database Connection Leaks
During testing, we discovered that database connections were not being properly closed, leading to connection pool exhaustion under load.

**Resolution:** We implemented proper connection management with context managers and added monitoring to detect similar issues in the future.

### Issue: Race Conditions in Concurrent Processing
When processing multiple requests concurrently, we encountered race conditions that led to inconsistent data states.

**Resolution:** We implemented proper locking mechanisms and used atomic operations where possible to ensure data consistency.

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Usage Optimization
We optimized memory usage by:
- Implementing lazy loading for large data structures
- Using generators instead of lists where possible
- Implementing proper garbage collection strategies

### Database Query Optimization
We optimized database queries by:
- Adding appropriate indexes
- Using query batching to reduce round trips
- Implementing query result caching for frequently accessed data

## Testing Strategies

### Effective Strategy: Property-Based Testing
We found property-based testing to be highly effective for validating the correctness of our data processing algorithms.

### Effective Strategy: Integration Testing with Mock Services
Using mock services for external dependencies in integration tests allowed us to test various scenarios without relying on external systems.

## Deviations from Original Plan

### Deviation: Changed Data Storage Format
We initially planned to use JSON for data storage but switched to Protocol Buffers for better performance and smaller storage footprint.

**Reason:** Performance testing showed that Protocol Buffers provided 30% better serialization performance and 40% reduction in storage size.

### Deviation: Additional Authentication Layer
We added an additional authentication layer for inter-service communication that wasn't in the original plan.

**Reason:** Security review identified a potential vulnerability in the original design that required this additional layer.
