fix: Update CI/CD workflows, resolve conflicts, and apply suggestions

This PR updates the existing CI/CD workflows, resolves merge conflicts, and applies automated code suggestions.

Key changes include:
- Resolved merge conflicts in .github/workflows/actionlint.yml by keeping the `fail_level: error` configuration.
- Implemented `gemini-code-assist` suggestion to refactor multiline output logic in .github/workflows/post_push_documentation.yml for improved robustness and readability.
- Updated `actionlint.yml` to use `github-pr-review` reporter and `fail_level: error` for better inline feedback on GitHub Actions workflow linting.
- Minor adjustments in `ci.yml` for robust `requirements.txt` handling.
- Enhanced variable quoting in `post_merge_issue_creation.yml` and `post_push_documentation.yml` for improved shell script robustness.
- Updated `triage-to-project.yml` permissions to `repository-projects: write` for compatibility with newer GitHub project board features.
- Resolved all Python linting (`ruff`) and type checking (`mypy`) issues in the codebase.

This addresses the underlying CI failures, aligns the project with stricter code quality standards, and incorporates feedback from automated tools.
